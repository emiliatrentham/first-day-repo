## Description
 As a University of Washington Coding Boot Camp student, it is my motivation to better my understanding of HTML and CSS code in preparation for my new career. Therefore, I've built this project in order to learn how to refactor HTML code to be semantically meaningful. As a result, I've also learned how to better organize my code to meet important accesability requirements.
